# React - Application

The application is split into four different pages i.e. a page for each task. Please find a small description for each question below:

# Question 1 and 2

For both of these questions I have made use of the same function from that is called from the backend. For question 1, the result will return one unique matching country, whilst for question 2, it will return a list of countries which partially match the inserted value by the user

# Question 3

In order to initially display the list of countries, I made use of the useEffect react hook, which initialises the list of countries, and is then filtered according to the value inserted by the user. 

# Question 4

A function is called each time the spin button is clicked which triggers the useEffect react hook that checks for any combinations which may have resulted from the spin. For capturing the combinations specified in the task, I made use of switch statements. Every time the spin results in reel which includes any of the combinations, the user is rewarded with further coins.
